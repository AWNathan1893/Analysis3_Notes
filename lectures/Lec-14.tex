\section{Compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$}

\begin{Def}{Compact Subset}{}
    A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be compact if every sequence $\{x_n\} \subseteq K$ has a subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ that is convergent to some $x \in K$.
\end{Def}

This is known as the Bolzano-Weierstrass Property.

Observe that a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is always closed. To see this, note that every sequence $\{x_n\} \subseteq K$, where $K$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ that converges to some $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ has a convergent subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ that converges to the same $x$. Since $K$ is compact, we can say that $x \in K$. So, the convergent sequence $\{x_n\}$ converges to a point in $K$. Hence, $K$ is closed.
